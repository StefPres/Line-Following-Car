# Line-Following-Car
This is an arduino code for my line following car, which uses a color sensor to follow a line as it moves. 

The line MUST be black, or else the color sensor will not pick it up.

The color sensor consists of 8 independent color sensors. Depending on which sensor picks up the line, the car will turn as needed.

The farther away from the center the line is, the harder the car will turn.
